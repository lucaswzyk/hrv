This is the code I used in my Bachelor Thesis "Modellierung und Analyse der Herzratenvariabilit√§t des Menschen"

The project is divided into 4 packages. The most important (intuitively named) scripts are listed here:
- analysis
  - dfa.py
  - wtmm.py
- generation
  - chiu_kao.py
  
Run them, see what comes out and adjust the settings at the top of the scripts to get a different output. 
Example data can be found in the package material.
